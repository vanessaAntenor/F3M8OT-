<h4 id="par"><p>Joseana Correia, Vanessa Antenor and Angeline Vasquez met this summer on the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion program. From that program, they have learned a lot about themselves but also about others. They understood a lot of stuff going on in the technology world as there's a lot more men than women working on that field.</p>
  <p>They also discovered there's so many discrimination such as, women getting paid less than men, women not being recognized for their work, and women being sexually harassed. As example, U.S. women working in science and high-tech fields are 45 percent more likely than their male peers to leave the industry within a year, often due to gender bias and feelings that they are being weighed against male counterparts. Also, between 2000 and 2014, the number of first-year undergraduate women interested in majoring in Computer Science declined by 7%. </p>
<p>As a result of what they learned, they decided to create F3M8OT$ which is a website spotlighting women in Tech, encouraging girls like us to learn more about their strenghts and also inviting people to have fun.</p> </h4>


<h3 id="pur"> What's the purpose of this website?</h3>
<h4 id="par"><p> We believe that the website could help increasing the pecentage of girls interested in STEM Field by showing them women who had accomplished so much in this field.</p>
  <p> But we aslo learned knowing your primary domain it's important because it helps you to figure out what can you do the best as being someone that can make things happen, someone that have influence on people, someone that has strategic thinking or you could just be someone that can work with anybody, a relationship builder. This is why we wanted to have a quiz page that allows people to know their primary domain </p>
<p> Furthermore, we have a page for entertainment where you can play some of the games that we created Also, we have a contact page for you to contact us to ask us more questions or to ven add more wonderful womenion our Women in Tech page</p></h4>

  <h4 id="par"><p> There's 4 different domains: Influencer, Doer, Strategist, and Relationship Builder. We created 4 different quizzes so you can see which one defines you the best. Some people might have more than one domain. And some might have all of them. This is why it's important to take all 4 quizzes.</p></h4>
